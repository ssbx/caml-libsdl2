My version of https://github.com/fccm/OCamlSDL2 using dune.
Done mostly:

- to facilitate addition of missing SDL2 features,
- to facilitate modifications of behaviour of existing ones,
- to have a starting code to write a performant SDL3 binding

I do not plan to support this. See alternatives:

- https://github.com/fccm/OCamlSDL2 (this code come from here)
- https://github.com/dbuenzli/tsdl (complete coverage of SDL2, uses FFI)
