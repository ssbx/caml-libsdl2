Sdl2 bindings of using dune and C.

Done mostly:

- to facilitate addition of missing SDL2 features,
- to facilitate modifications of behaviour of existing ones,
- to have a starting code to write a future SDL3 binding

I do not plan to support this. See alternatives:

- https://github.com/fccm/OCamlSDL2 (this code come from here)
- https://github.com/dbuenzli/tsdl (complete coverage of SDL2, uses FFI)

Original code come from Florent Monnier excellent work with
https://github.com/fccm/OCamlSDL2.
